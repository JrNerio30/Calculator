# About Calculator

This is my small [Calculator](https://jrnerio30.github.io/Calculator/) project.
With this project, I'll be able to enhance my understanding of design and development using Figma (Designing Software) and SCSS (Development).

## I've learned:
* Learned how to shorten the time of development by adding a math file for the calculator.
* Learned how to use more JavaScript coding than using HTML code over and over again. Specifically the Table, td, tr elements, and the input button types.
* Learned to use a proper way to write a descriptive message when creating a pull request, for more organized and professional practices. 

ðŸ«€I am committed to further enhancing my understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript and continuously strengthening my skills as a Web Developer.
